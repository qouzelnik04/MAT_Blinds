# Setup 

## Introduction
- After the software is uploaded to the board, it still needs to be set up.

- We need to calibrate the blinds. First we go to (setup -> engines -> test). Now the blinds should go up, if not we press the button. We go to (settings -> engines) and here we click on Invert A/B/C/D according to which blind we need to invert. We go to (setup -> engines -> test) again and now all the blinds should be pulling up. If not, repeat the process, if yes, press the button again.

- Now we calibrate each blind. We go to (settings -> calibration) and here we will gradually calibrate each blind by clicking on the desired blind and then follow the instructions on the display.

- Now we just have to set the time in the settings and when we want to pull up / pull down the blinds.
